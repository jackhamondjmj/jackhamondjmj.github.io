            <h2>The Intention of This Blog</h2>
            <p>In the modern age full of constant consumption, instant gratification, and endless updates one does not have any time to think or reflect on life. The world is full of useless "neccesary" products to waste ones life away and make one feel depressed and lethargic. This blog is not intended to exacerbate these problems. If you, dear reader, find yourself somehow doom-scrolling on this site, please leave! I will be perfecly delighted and content if this blog is never read or visited by anyone other than myself. This blog is an attempt for me to escape the depleted life of perpetual consumption. Instead of consuming I will be creating. The blog is going to be a place for me to document my occasional thoughts and ideas. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will not be used in this blog. I will permit myself to use dictionaries, thesauri, books, articles, documentaries, podcasts, and even videos, but not AI. I may do blogposts that are prepared, purposeful, and deliberate, but othertimes they may resemble more of a catch-all journal. This blog really is going to be what the word "blog" is short for: weblog&mdash;a place for me to occasionally log thoughts on the web. I cannot promise anything even remotely resembling perfection in this blog&mdash;I do not consider myself anything of a writer; one of the intentions of this blog is to become a writer&mdash;or at least thinker. I possess a true love for books, but I have not developed the love and skill of thinking about the books I read. What a shame! I have realized that I must write so that I may learn how to think. Chesterton said in part four of What's Wrong with the World that "if a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly." I am going to write and write badly; do not be offended when I write so poorly because I do so to someday write beautifully.</p>

            <h3>Why Publish it on the Internet?</h3>
            <p>Dear reader, some may ask why I choose to post this blog to the internet when I have given the impression that it is purely for my own improvement. Why not, instead, buy a beautiful notebook with a fountian pen and write in there? There are many reasons why I have decided to publish my thoughts to the internet. I do not wish to give the impression that I think technology is evil <i>per se</i>. There are numerous benefits to things such as the internet. One must be careful, though, because the benefits are what makes the internet perilous. Some of the reasons why I have decided to post this blog to this internet are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Accessibility and Centralization. I usually have my phone&mdash;also known as a Portable Enslavement Device (PED)&mdash;nearby and I not want to carry 77 notebooks in my pocket.</li>
                    <li>Dialogue and Sharing. Although I do not want any reader to ever enjoy this blog enough to be on for "too much time," I could potentially see myself sharing blogposts with family and friends to start conversations and share ideas.</li>
                    <li>Learning. I have&mdash;in very small increments&mdash;been learning about web design. This blog will help me practice html, css, and javascript.</li>
                </ol>
            <p>Pen and paper will forever be superior to typing on a keyboard. Posting this blog to the internet will never stop me from writing with pen and paper&mdash;I am on a constant endeavor to perfect my  penmanship. I am continuously seeking to move away from advanced technologies when I can, in favor of a simpler way of living, but I do not find this blog to be too opposing. I will forever be a High-Functioning Troglodyte (HFT)! </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The human race has built so many advanced tools to make our lives better and yet we seem to be losing our humanity. The digital world is replacing the real world. Real thinking is not happening because we are too occupied on JewTube. This blog is an attempt to think and to portray my thoughts. I will attempt to think well in a coherent, organized manner. Pefection will be my goal and not my enemy.
