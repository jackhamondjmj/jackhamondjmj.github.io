      <h2>Catholic</h2><h3>The Pelagian Drinking Song</h3><h4>By Hilaire Belloc</h4>
      <p>Pelagius lived at Kardanoel<br>
        And taught a doctrine there<br>
        How, whether you went to heaven or to hell<br>
        It was your own affair.<br>
        It had nothing to do with the Church, my boy,<br>
        But was your own affair.<br><br>
      No, he didn’t believe<br>
        In Adam and Eve<br>
        He put no faith therein!<br>
        His doubts began<br>
        With the Fall of Man<br>
        And he laughed at Original Sin.<br>
        <i>With my row-ti-tow<br>
        Ti-oodly-ow<br>
        He laughed at original sin.</i><br><br>
      Then came the bishop of old Auxerre<br>
        Germanus was his name<br>
        He tore great handfuls out of his hair<br>
        And he called Pelagius shame.<br>
        And with his stout Episcopal staff<br>
        So thoroughly whacked and banged<br>
        The heretics all, both short and tall—<br>
        They rather had been hanged.<br><br>
      Oh he whacked them hard, and he banged them long<br>
        Upon each and all occasions<br>
        Till they bellowed in chorus, loud and strong<br>
        Their orthodox persuasions.<br>
        <i>With my row-ti-tow<br>
        Ti-oodly-ow<br>
        Their orthodox persuasions.</i><br><br>
      Now the faith is old and the Devil bold<br>
        Exceedingly bold indeed.<br>
        And the masses of doubt that are floating about<br>
        Would smo ther a mortal creed.<br>
        But we that sit in a sturdy youth<br>
        And still can drink strong ale<br>
        Let us put it away to infallible truth<br>
        That always shall prevail.<br><br>
      And thank the Lord<br>
        For the temporal sword<br>
        And howling heretics too.<br>
        And all good things<br>
        Our Christendom brings<br>
        But especially barley brew!<br>
        <i>With my row-ti-tow<br>
        Ti-oodly-ow<br>
        Especially barley brew!</i><br>
