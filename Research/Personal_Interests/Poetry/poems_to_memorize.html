      <h2>Catholic</h2>
      <h3>Limbo</h3>
      <h4>By Sr. Mary Ada OSJ</h4>
      <p>The ancient greyness shifted
        Suddenly and thinned
        Like mist upon the moors
        Before a wind.

        An old, old prophet lifted
        A shining face and said:
        “He will be coming soon.
        The Son of God is dead;
        He died this afternoon.”

        A murmurous excitement stirred all souls.
        They wondered if they dreamed—
        Save one old man who seemed
        Not even to have heard.

        And Moses standing,
        Hushed them all to ask
        If any had a welcome song prepared.
        If not, would David take the task?

        And if they cared
        Could not the three young children sing
        The Benedicite, the canticle of praise
        They made when God kept them from perishing
        In the fiery blaze?

        A breath of spring surprised them,
        Stilling Moses’ words.
        No one could speak, remembering
        The first fresh flowers,
        The little singing birds.

        Still others thought of fields new ploughed
        Or apple trees 
        All blossom–boughed.
        Or some, the way a dried bed fills
        With water
        Laughing down green hills.  

        The fisherfolk dreamed of the foam
        On bright blue seas.
        The one old man who had not stirred
        Remembered home.

        And there He was
        Splendid as the morning sun and fair
        As only God is fair.
        And they, confused with joy,
        Knelt to adore
        Seeing that He wore
        Five crimson stars
        He never had before

        No canticle at all was sung.
        None toned a psalm, or raised a greeting song.
        A silent man alone
        Of all that throng
        Found tongue —
        Not any other.
        
        Close to His heart
        When the embrace was done,
        Old Joseph said,
        “How is Your Mother,
        How is Your Mother, Son?”   
      </p>
      <h3>The Pelagian Drinking Song</h3>
      <h4>By Hilaire Belloc</h4>
      <p>Pelagius lived at Kardanoel
        And taught a doctrine there
        How, whether you went to heaven or to hell
        It was your own affair.
        It had nothing to do with the Church, my boy,
        But was your own affair.

        No, he didn’t believe
        In Adam and Eve
        He put no faith therein!
        His doubts began
        With the Fall of Man
        And he laughed at Original Sin.
        <i>With my row-ti-tow
        Ti-oodly-ow
        He laughed at original sin.</i>

        Then came the bishop of old Auxerre
        Germanus was his name
        He tore great handfuls out of his hair
        And he called Pelagius shame.
        And with his stout Episcopal staff
        So thoroughly whacked and banged
        The heretics all, both short and tall—
        They rather had been hanged.

        Oh he whacked them hard, and he banged them long
        Upon each and all occasions
        Till they bellowed in chorus, loud and strong
        Their orthodox persuasions.
        <i>With my row-ti-tow
        Ti-oodly-ow
        Their orthodox persuasions.</i>

        Now the faith is old and the Devil bold
        Exceedingly bold indeed.
        And the masses of doubt that are floating about
        Would smo ther a mortal creed.
        But we that sit in a sturdy youth
        And still can drink strong ale
        Let us put it away to infallible truth
        That always shall prevail.

        And thank the Lord
        For the temporal sword
        And howling heretics too.
        And all good things
        Our Christendom brings
        But especially barley brew!
        <i>With my row-ti-tow
        Ti-oodly-ow
        Especially barley brew!</i>
