      <h2>Catholic</h2><h3>Limbo</h3><h4>By Sr. Mary Ada OSJ</h4>
      <p>The ancient greyness shifted<br>
        Suddenly and thinned<br>
        Like mist upon the moors<br>
        Before a wind.<br><br>
      An old, old prophet lifted<br>
        A shining face and said:<br>
        “He will be coming soon.<br>
        The Son of God is dead;<br>
        He died this afternoon.”<br><br>
      A murmurous excitement stirred all souls.<br>
        They wondered if they dreamed—<br>
        Save one old man who seemed<br>
        Not even to have heard.<br><br>
      And Moses standing,<br>
        Hushed them all to ask<br>
        If any had a welcome song prepared.<br>
        If not, would David take the task?<br><br>
      And if they cared<br>
        Could not the three young children sing<br>
        The Benedicite, the canticle of praise<br>
        They made when God kept them from perishing<br>
        In the fiery blaze?<br><br>
      A breath of spring surprised them,<br>
        Stilling Moses’ words.<br>
        No one could speak, remembering<br>
        The first fresh flowers,<br>
        The little singing birds.<br><br>
      Still others thought of fields new ploughed<br>
        Or apple trees<br>
        All blossom–boughed.<br>
        Or some, the way a dried bed fills<br>
        With water<br>
        Laughing down green hills.<br><br>
      The fisherfolk dreamed of the foam<br>
        On bright blue seas.<br>
        The one old man who had not stirred<br>
        Remembered home.<br><br>
      And there He was<br>
        Splendid as the morning sun and fair<br>
        As only God is fair.<br>
        And they, confused with joy,<br>
        Knelt to adore<br>
        Seeing that He wore<br>
        Five crimson stars<br>
        He never had before<br><br>
      No canticle at all was sung.<br>
        None toned a psalm, or raised a greeting song.<br>
        A silent man alone<br>
        Of all that throng<br>
        Found tongue —<br>
        Not any other.<br><br>
      Close to His heart<br>
        When the embrace was done,<br>
        Old Joseph said,<br>
        “How is Your Mother,<br>
        How is Your Mother, Son?”<br>
