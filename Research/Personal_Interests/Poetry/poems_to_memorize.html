      <h2>Catholic</h2>
      <h3>Limbo</h3>
      <h4>By Sr. Mary Ada OSJ</h4>
      <p>The ancient greyness shifted<br>
        Suddenly and thinned<br>
        Like mist upon the moors<br>
        Before a wind.<br><br>
      An old, old prophet lifted<br>
        A shining face and said:<br>
        “He will be coming soon.<br>
        The Son of God is dead;<br>
        He died this afternoon.”<br><br>
      A murmurous excitement stirred all souls.<br>
        They wondered if they dreamed—<br>
        Save one old man who seemed<br>
        Not even to have heard.<br><br>
      And Moses standing,<br>
        Hushed them all to ask<br>
        If any had a welcome song prepared.<br>
        If not, would David take the task?<br><br>
      And if they cared<br>
        Could not the three young children sing<br>
        The Benedicite, the canticle of praise<br>
        They made when God kept them from perishing<br>
        In the fiery blaze?<br><br>
      A breath of spring surprised them,<br>
        Stilling Moses’ words.<br>
        No one could speak, remembering<br>
        The first fresh flowers,<br>
        The little singing birds.<br><br>
      Still others thought of fields new ploughed<br>
        Or apple trees<br>
        All blossom–boughed.<br>
        Or some, the way a dried bed fills<br>
        With water<br>
        Laughing down green hills.<br><br>
      The fisherfolk dreamed of the foam<br>
        On bright blue seas.<br>
        The one old man who had not stirred<br>
        Remembered home.<br><br>
      And there He was<br>
        Splendid as the morning sun and fair<br>
        As only God is fair.<br>
        And they, confused with joy,<br>
        Knelt to adore<br>
        Seeing that He wore<br>
        Five crimson stars<br>
        He never had before<br><br>
      No canticle at all was sung.<br>
        None toned a psalm, or raised a greeting song.<br>
        A silent man alone<br>
        Of all that throng<br>
        Found tongue —<br>
        Not any other.<br><br>
      Close to His heart<br>
        When the embrace was done,<br>
        Old Joseph said,<br>
        “How is Your Mother,<br>
        How is Your Mother, Son?”<br> 
      </p>
      <h3>The Pelagian Drinking Song</h3>
      <h4>By Hilaire Belloc</h4>
      <p>Pelagius lived at Kardanoel<br>
        And taught a doctrine there<br>
        How, whether you went to heaven or to hell<br>
        It was your own affair.<br>
        It had nothing to do with the Church, my boy,<br>
        But was your own affair.<br><br>
      No, he didn’t believe<br>
        In Adam and Eve<br>
        He put no faith therein!<br>
        His doubts began<br>
        With the Fall of Man<br>
        And he laughed at Original Sin.<br>
        <i>With my row-ti-tow<br>
        Ti-oodly-ow<br>
        He laughed at original sin.</i><br><br>
      Then came the bishop of old Auxerre<br>
        Germanus was his name<br>
        He tore great handfuls out of his hair<br>
        And he called Pelagius shame.<br>
        And with his stout Episcopal staff<br>
        So thoroughly whacked and banged<br>
        The heretics all, both short and tall—<br>
        They rather had been hanged.<br><br>
      Oh he whacked them hard, and he banged them long<br>
        Upon each and all occasions<br>
        Till they bellowed in chorus, loud and strong<br>
        Their orthodox persuasions.<br>
        <i>With my row-ti-tow<br>
        Ti-oodly-ow<br>
        Their orthodox persuasions.</i><br><br>
      Now the faith is old and the Devil bold<br>
        Exceedingly bold indeed.<br>
        And the masses of doubt that are floating about<br>
        Would smo ther a mortal creed.<br>
        But we that sit in a sturdy youth<br>
        And still can drink strong ale<br>
        Let us put it away to infallible truth<br>
        That always shall prevail.<br><br>
      And thank the Lord<br>
        For the temporal sword<br>
        And howling heretics too.<br>
        And all good things<br>
        Our Christendom brings<br>
        But especially barley brew!<br>
        <i>With my row-ti-tow<br>
        Ti-oodly-ow<br>
        Especially barley brew!</i><br>
